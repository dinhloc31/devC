## 1. ðŸ“¦ Requirement

### Exercise 1: Singleton Pattern for SensorManager

In a sensor data management system, it is required that only **one instance** of the `SensorManager` object exists throughout the entire system. The main responsibilities of the `SensorManager` are:
- Managing and collecting data from sensor nodes (`SensorNode`).
- Efficiently and consistently uploading data to the database.

If the system does not guarantee a single instance of `SensorManager`, several serious issues may arise:
- **Data Duplication:** Multiple `SensorManager` objects may collect the same data from sensors, leading to duplicate entries in the database.
- **Resource Conflicts:** Different `SensorManager` instances may access and manipulate shared resources simultaneously, causing conflicts or unexpected errors.
- **Difficult Control:** Managing and tracking the behavior of multiple `SensorManager` objects becomes complex, reducing the system's stability and maintainability.

**Requirement:**
- Propose and implement a solution to ensure that only one instance of the `SensorManager` object is created in the entire system.
- Explain how your solution addresses the issues mentioned
