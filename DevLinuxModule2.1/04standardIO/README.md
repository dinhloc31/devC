# 04standardIO

This folder demonstrates the use of standard input/output (I/O) operations in C, including logging to files and basic file handling.

## Files

- `main.c`: Main program demonstrating standard I/O operations.
- `logger.c` / `logger.h`: Implementation and header for a simple logging utility.
- `log.txt`: Output log file generated by the program.
- `Makefile`: Build instructions for compiling the program.

## Project requirement
Logging to multiple destinations (console, file).
Filtering log messages based on severity level (for example: only show errors, ignore debug information).
Automatically adding useful information such as timestamp, filename, and line number to each log message.

This exercise requires you to build a complete logger module that can be configured and used in any C project, following clean code principles and good module organization.

Software requirements:
Source structure:

logger.h

logger.c

main.c

Log Levels: Use an enum to define 8 log levels according to the syslog standard:

LOG_EMERGENCY

LOG_ALERT

LOG_CRITICAL

LOG_ERROR

LOG_WARNING

LOG_NOTICE

LOG_INFO

LOG_DEBUG

Log Format:
Each log line must follow the standard format:
[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS] [LEVEL] [FILENAME:LINE] - Message
Example:
[2024-07-20 11:45:10] [ERROR] [main.c:25] - Failed to connect to database.

Functional requirements:
Multi-target Logger:
The logger must be able to log simultaneously to the console (stderr for severe errors, stdout for normal logs) and optionally to a text file.
File logging is optional and configured during initialization.

Level Filtering:
The logger must be configurable with a minimum log level (e.g., LOG_INFO).
Any log message with a lower priority (numerically higher value) than the configured level will be ignored and not logged.
There should be a function to change this filtering level at runtime.

Automatic Metadata:
The logger must automatically capture and insert the timestamp, source filename, and line number at the beginning of each log message.
Hint: use compiler macros like __FILE__ and __LINE__.

Convenience Interface:
Create a macro log_message(...) so users can conveniently call it without manually specifying __FILE__ and __LINE__.

Goals to achieve:

Master using functions with variable argument lists (stdarg.h).

Proficient use of snprintf and vsnprintf for safe string formatting.

Understand and apply file I/O techniques (fopen, fprintf, fclose, fflush).

Use static to encapsulate state within a C module.

Create and use useful macros (__FILE__, __LINE__).

Build a complete, reusable C module.
## How to Build

1. Open a terminal in this directory.
2. Run the following command:

make all

   This will compile the program and generate the executable `main`.

## How to Run

After building, run the program with:

./main

or double-click `main` in Windows Explorer.

## Features

- Demonstrates file logging using a custom logger.
- Shows basic usage of standard I/O functions in C.

## Cleaning Up

To remove compiled files and logs, run:

make clean
