This folder demonstrates the use of standard input/output (I/O) operations in C, including logging to files and basic file handling.

## Files

- `main.c`: Main program demonstrating standard I/O operations.
- `logger.c` / `logger.h`: Implementation and header for a simple logging utility.
- `log.txt`: Output log file generated by the program.
- `Makefile`: Build instructions for compiling the program.

## How to Build

1. Open a terminal in this directory.
2. Run the following command:

   ```sh
   make
   ```

   This will compile the program and generate the executable `main.exe`.

## How to Run

After building, run the program with:

```sh
./main.exe
```

or double-click `main.exe` in Windows Explorer.

## Features

- Demonstrates file logging using a custom logger.
